# MotoButtons 2

### *MotoButtons 2 is a work in progress. The date of completion will be September 29, 2024. I had the case printed and ordered the remaining parts. I got a good deal on an industrial 4-way joystick, so I'll be writing the code for that option first.*

Welcome to MotoButtons 2, the low-cost, waterproof, DIY Bluetooth motorcycle controller. Version 2 features many upgrades over [the original](https://github.com/joncox123/MotoButtons):
- 3D printed case with handlebar mount
- Separate RGB LED for indicating modes and status
- Commercial, IP68 5-way (or 4-way) castle joystick
- Three pushbuttons

The target price to order all parts, including the case, is approximately $80 to $100 excluding shipping costs. The main variable is the cost and quality of the 3D printed case. However, the most expensive part is the IP68 rated 5-way joystick. The cheapest available is from Ruffy Controls, although industry prices for similar parts vary from $45 to beyond $300. Lastly, the least expensive service for 3D printing is [Craftcloud](https://craftcloud3d.com/).
